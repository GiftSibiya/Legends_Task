# Legend Task Application

The legend takser application made quick, fast and in a hurry. 


## Made with ❤️ using:
- **React.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **JavaScript**


## Optimizations

The authentication is elementary at best, just comparing the created password (unencrypted mind you) and is they are equal, will pass the user to the home page. A 
password encryption (such as bcrypt for mongdb) will really be beneficial with some JWT Authentication.

User based Tasks for tasks that appear to certain users instead of all the users having to share the same task sheet. 

## Lessons Learned

Making qpplications with a close deadline in mind can cause a belief that speed is the solution, but i have learned to carefully work on one piece at a time to achieve 
progress.
